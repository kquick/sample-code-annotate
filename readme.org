This is a small example of using emacs org-mode and babel to generate
annotated code descriptions.

The code is included and a reference is added to each line that will
be referenced (only one reference per line is supported).

Lines are automatically numbered by org-mode babel.

Org links in HTML can reference the lines in the link aref and the
text.

Uses htmlize + CSS for code decoration.
